//Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object
//describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an
//album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of
//information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different
//albums. Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the
//album information correctly.
//Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the
//number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number
//of tracks, add that value to the album's object. make at least one new function call 
// that includes the number of tracks on an album.
